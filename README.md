# AI Web Scraper

An intelligent web scraping solution that combines the power of AI with web scraping capabilities to extract and analyze data from websites. This project uses Ollama for AI processing, Selenium for web automation, and Beautiful Soup for HTML parsing. What sets this scraper apart is its smart CAPTCHA bypassing capabilities and IP blocking prevention mechanisms, making it highly efficient for scraping protected websites while maintaining ethical browsing practices and ensuring continuous data collection without interruptions.

## üìå Features

- AI-powered web scraping using Ollama
- Intelligent CAPTCHA bypassing mechanism
- Advanced IP blocking prevention system
- Smart request rate limiting and rotation
- Dynamic website handling with Selenium
- Intelligent data extraction and parsing
- Structured data output in table format
- Easy-to-use interface
- Efficient and reliable data collection from protected websites

_Example of structured data output - Property information organized in a clean, readable table format_

The scraper intelligently processes websites and generates structured table outputs, making it easy to analyze and process the scraped data. As shown in the example above, it can handle complex data like property listings, including details such as:

- Property specifications (BHK, Size)
- Price ranges
- Location details
- Builder information
- Registration numbers
